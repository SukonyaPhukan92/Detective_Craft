Rules of minesweeper
 Each "Detective Craft" game starts out with a grid of unmarked squares. 
 After clicking one of these squares, some of the squares will disappear, some will remain blank, and some will have numbers on them. 
 It's the job of the player to use the numbers to figure out which of the blank squares have mines and which are safe to click.
The first click will never be a mine.
It will clear the map and place numbers on the grid. 
The numbers reflect the number of mines touching a square
